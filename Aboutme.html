        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        
        <p>I am a passionate developer and problem solver with a strong foundation in programming and team leadership. My journey in the world of technology began at Kendriya Vidyalaya Barrackpore Airforce, West Bengal, where I developed an early interest in computers and software development. Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Swami Vivekananda University, Barrackpore, further strengthening my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.
            With a deep passion for coding, I specialize in Java (OOPs), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I continuously explore new technologies to expand my skill set. I love tackling complex problems and designing efficient, scalable solutions. My ability to think critically and solve challenges efficiently makes me an asset to any team or project.
            
            As a team leader, I believe in collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning. I enjoy guiding teams, brainstorming new ideas, and working on challenging projects that push the boundaries of technology. Whether it’s developing a full-stack application, optimizing algorithms, or creating user-friendly interfaces, I am always eager to dive deep into the technical aspects and deliver high-quality results.
            
            What sets me apart is my ability to analyze, adapt, and innovate. I thrive in fast-paced environments, embrace challenges, and constantly seek opportunities to enhance my knowledge and expertise. My strong problem-solving mindset enables me to break down complex problems into manageable solutions, making development more structured and efficient.
            
            Beyond coding, I am always eager to learn about emerging technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for software development. My ultimate goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact in the field of computer science.
            
            If you’re looking for a dedicated, enthusiastic, and innovative developer who enjoys problem-solving and team leadership, I’d love to connect and explore exciting opportunities together!
